<h1 align="center"> Analysis of Sorting Algorithm(Insertion, Merge, Radix) </h1>

<p align="justify">
The sorting algorithm is written in Java and the analysis starts
by generating integer values ranging from 1 to 1 million of size
500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000 and 30000. For each set, it will run for 5 times and a graph
for the best case, average case and worst case is plotted. Best case consists of integer that
are already sorted in ascending order while worst case consist of integer that are already
sorted in descending order. Moreover, average case consists of integers that are in random
order. Then, the total primitive operations of comparison, assignment and arithmetic are
calculated and tabulated. After that, a graph of the total of primitive operation is plotted and
the result is being compared and discussed with the time complexity found on the textbook.
The details of each run of respective sorting algorithm, result and discussion
can be found and read
in the attached
documentation pdf file. </p>
